# Handling Energy Consumption Data with Pandas  
### Missing Values and Data Preprocessing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on handling and preprocessing energy consumption data using **Python and Pandas**.  
The main goal is to clean the dataset by identifying missing values, handling inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis or machine learning tasks.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates real-world data preprocessing techniques.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains energy consumption records with the following example columns:

- `Date` – Date of energy consumption
- `Time` – Time of measurement
- `Global_active_power` – Household global minute-averaged active power (kW)
- `Global_reactive_power` – Household global minute-averaged reactive power (kW)
- `Voltage` – Minute-averaged voltage (V)
- `Global_intensity` – Household global minute-averaged current (A)
- `Sub_metering_1`, `Sub_metering_2`, `Sub_metering_3` – Energy sub-metering values

⚠️ The dataset contains **missing values**, which are handled in this project.
